# Runbooks

This directory contains procedural guides for common tasks. Keep steps precise, testable, and version-controlled.

Suggested runbooks:
- local-development.md — setup environment, run app, linting
- deploying.md — build and deploy steps, environment variables
- incident-response.md — triage, escalation, and recovery steps
- database-migrations.md — how to create, review, and apply Doctrine migrations

General guidance:
- Prefer commands that can be copy-pasted
- Include prerequisites and expected outcomes
- Keep environment-specific details in secure docs (not committed)
